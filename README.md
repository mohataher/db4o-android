This repository has the required code to generate a fully functioning db4o jar file.

Originally, there is a bug that does not allow db#store() to work properly. I made a simple patch to the code and generated a new JAR file for db4o.
For more details about the bug, please have a look here

To download the jar file, please download it from bin/ folder.

This JAR file is tested on Android 4.4.4 (Nexus 5)
Please test it on older versions and notify me.
